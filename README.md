# NW.js + Svelte Template

This is a template built to handle the nitty-gritty parts of running a desktop app, and lets you write.

## Using the template

Simply clone or click "Use this template" button to get a copy of this repo.

Include your code in `src/App.svelte`.

Then run `yarn start` and the script will download the NW.js binary and open a window with your code (may take several seconds for first build).

You'll see `Hello (platform)!` in the centre.

Happy coding!

## Commands

- `yarn start`

> Starts a file watcher and launches the app with live code reload.

- `yarn build`

> Builds your app and moves it into the NW.js folder to be packaged.

- `yarn launch`

> Launches the app
> Note: `yarn build` should be ran before this as it'll use the default NW.js `index.html`.
